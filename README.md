SimpleTask Monokai Spacegray
============================

![](https://raw.github.com/danieldiekmeier/simpletask-monokai-spacegray/master/screenshot.png)

## Why?

If you know [SimpleTask](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks) for Sublime Text, you may also know how incredibly ugly it is. So I made my own theme that fits my [Monokai Spacegray-Theme](https://github.com/danieldiekmeier/Monokai-Spacegray). As a bonus, you get my SimpleTask-Settings that don't suck quite as much.

## Installation

On a Mac, go to `Sublime Text → Preferences → Browse Packages`, then to `PlainTasks`, and drop the `tasks-monokai-spacegray.hidden-tmTheme`-file there. Then open the PlainTasks-Settings by going to `Sublime Text → Package Settings → PlainTasks → Settings – User` and paste the contents of the `PlainTasks.sublime-settings`-file into it.

Restart Sublime Text and enjoy your infinite productivity.
