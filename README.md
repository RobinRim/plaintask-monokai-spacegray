simpletask-monokai-spacegray
============================

A SimpleTask-Theme that fits my Monokai Spacegray-Theme.

# Why?

If you know [SimpleTask](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks) for Sublime Text, you may also know how incredibly ugly it is. So I made my own theme that fits my [Monokai Spacegray-Theme](https://github.com/danieldiekmeier/Monokai-Spacegray). As a bonus, you get my SimpleTask-Settings that don't suck quite as much.
